A new Flutter project.

## ABSTRACT 	
The main purpose of this project is to develop a real time bus tracking system to enhance the current bus service system and reduce the workload of the bus management team. students are impatient while they are waiting at the bus stop because they are not able to know exactly how long to wait and where the next coming bus is. Global Positioning System (GPS) is the main technology implemented behind the system. A GPS receiver in drivers mobile is used to track on real time bus coordination by continuously receiving the position data which are latitude and longitude values from Places API then send the position data back to the main server and server process the raw position data into real time information for users. This system is implemented on the Internet so that passengers are able to view the information through Mobile.


## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. The System must be able to show information to users in real time.
2. The system must be able to process the position data received from the Bus Locating Module and calculate the estimated time to the user.
3. The system must be able to show estimated arrival time for bus in every bus stop
4. The system must be able to allow user retrieve information from mobile device
5. The system must be able to do mapping with position data retrieved from bus Locating Module and show the bus position in a map to User.
6. The System must be able to save the addresses from the user.
7. The System must be able to show the users that are riding the bus.

##  NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. The system should provide the accurate estimated bus arrival time to users.
2. The system should reduce the paperwork done by the bus management team. 
3. The system should be able to increase the efficiency and performance of bus service. 
4. The system should reduce work done by the bus management team by automated calculation of estimated bus arrival time and showing real time bus position to users. 
5. The system should allow users to access information anywhere , anytime.
